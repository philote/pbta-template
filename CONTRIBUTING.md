# How to use the system locally

With the change to LevelDB, there is an extra step to create the packs locally.

- Clone the repository as usual
- You need to have a node.js installation done
- run `npm install`: will generate the node_modules depending on package.json and package-lock.json
- then `npm run build` to build once or `npm run watch` to have a SCSS watcher running to update the CSS when SCSS is updated automatically.
- If you want Foundry to hot-reload pages as you make updates, you will need to launch Foundry with the `--hotReload` flag. See [Using Command Line Flags](https://foundryvtt.com/article/configuration/)
- To save the compendiums to JSON for better version control (and go from JSON to LevelDB):
    - You must be in the Foundry welcome page (or have it completely closed) and NOT in a world you want to convert compendium from. 
    - To convert JSON to LevelDB after a fresh pull from git or manually editing the JSON file: In the system directory use `npm run pullJSONtoLDB` will create the packs depending of the content of src/packs directory
    - To convert LevelDB to JSON after making changes to compendiums in Foundry: In the system directory use `npm run pushLDBtoJSON` will create JSON in the src/packs folder, then you can push your updates upstream.
- `npm run createSymlinks` - Create development symlinks for improved intellisense
    - You will need to update `example-foundry-config.yaml` & `example-jsconfig.json`
    - documentation: https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/improving-intellisense

# To update the packs
Make sure Foundry is not running first.
-  LDB to JSON for syncing to git : npm run pushLDBtoJSON will create the src/packs files and export all actors/items in json files
-  JSON to LDB for testing locally : npm run pullJSONtoLDB will create the LevelDB folders from the JSON files in the src/packs folder

# Macro for migrating compendium packs (for the PbtA System)
```javascript
for (let pack of game.packs) {
    if (pack.metadata.packageName !== "pbta-template") continue;
    if (!["Actor", "Item", "Scene"].includes(pack.documentName)) continue;
    await game.pbta.migrations.migrateCompendium(pack);
}
```
